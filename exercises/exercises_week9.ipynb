For each case I have suggested some sources of information, although you will probably want to google and youtube a bit yourself to get a better understanding. I have also suggested some things you can put in your essay if you get stuck, but these are only suggestions and you can probably imagine many better things to touch upon.\n",

Part of the reason why I pose this exercise is that I want to learn something from you.\n",
